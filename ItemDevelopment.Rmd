# Procedure

Resource: Procedure item development in teams.

1. Go to project folder
2. Navigate to desired taxonomy level 1 folder
3. Create a new folder for each new item
4. Name your item following instruction
5. Create HTML version
6. Quality check

## Naming instruction

<small>
[abbreviation institution]-[lowest taxonomy level for item]-[nummber ###]-[NL/EN]
</small>

example: 

* uva-regression-001-nl.Rmd

If available:

* uva-regression-001-nl-graph01.jpg 
* uva-regression-001-nl-data01.sav

# Item types

There are five item types available in R ([Resource](http://www.r-exams.org/intro/dynamic/)).

* **Multiple choice:** `extype: schoice` (s: single)
* **Multiple answer:** `extype: mchoice` (m: multiple)
* **Fill in the blank numbers:** `extype: num`
* **Fill in the blank text/essay:** `extype: string`
* **Combinations:** `extype: cloze`
* Adding images and attachments

## Adding images and attachments {.small}

Adding image or files to your question.

1. Add the image or file (.png .jpg .sav etc.) to the same folder as your question.
2. Add the code below at the top of your .Rmd file.
3. Add `![](myImage.png)` at location for image. Replace `myImage` with your own.
4. Add `[Download](myFile.xls)` at location for the download. Replace `myFile` with your own.

````markdown
`r ''````{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
include_supplement("myImage.png", recursive = TRUE)
```
````

# Adding meta information

## Statistics taxonomy

You can add the taxonomy to the `exsection` attribute in the meta information.

```{}
Meta-information
================
exsection: Descriptive statistics / Summary Statistics / Measures of Spread / Standard Deviation, Inferential Statistics / Parametric Techniques / t-test / One sample mean
```

* The [taxonomy tree can be found here](https://sharestats.github.io/Statistics_Taxonomy/Statistics_Taxonomy.html#Assigning_taxonomy).
* Multiple paths can be added by using a comma as seperator.
* Only add path that is most specific for the question.
* **New lines are not allowed**

## Adding Tags

You can add tags to the `exextra[]` attribute in the meta information.

```{}
Meta-information
================
exextra[Type]: Calculation, Data manipulation
exextra[Program]: SPSS
exextra[Language]: English
exextra[Level]: Statistical Literacy
```

* We have four categories that can be used [tag tab](https://sharestats.github.io/Statistics_Taxonomy/Statistics_Taxonomy.html#Assigning_taxonomy).
* Multiple tags can be added by using a comma as seperator.
* Type, Language and level are required. Only use Program when needed.
* **New lines are not allowed**

# Compiling your item

## HTML example

You are required to compile the item to HTML. Run the `exams2html()` function to test your .Rmd file.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("exams", dependencies = TRUE)
library(exams)
exams2html(file = "")
```

# Quality check

## Procedure

Follow the quality checklist available in the teams general channel.
